# CLI YOUTUBE

**Watch Youtube vids in your Command line**

## Requirements
- `Python3`
- [ytcc](https://github.com/woefe/ytcc)

  For the moment ytcc needs to be set up seperately from the command line first before running this script.
  This includes importing/saving current Youtube Subcriptions from Google Takeout, more details in the repo.

## Running

first time and every time you need to check for new videos(for now), run:
`ytcc update`
then
`python3 ./main.py` from the project dir to run this script.
